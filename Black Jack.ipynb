    "# Black Jack:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation:\n",
    "- Whenever I get nervous or my day is not going well, I play a hand of Blackjack with my cards. If I get a good hand the I get some motivation that my day would get better. Else I focus on minimizing my mistakes and determine to have a productive end to my day. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One day, I lost my jack of clubs. So I thought why not make a Python project on the game, because then I'll never lose any cards LOL!! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules:\n",
    "- The game is played with a deck of 52 cards where the strategies play at best. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Cards are shuffled, the buy-in amount is established and player receives two card at first. Based on the ranking of the cards, the total points in hand is decided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dealer my hit (provide another card for the hand) the player if he/she demands but the points may never exceed 21. If it does exceed, player loses the hand. Dealer may hit himself as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All non face cards have same points as their numerals, while the face cards are worth 10 points each except Ace. For Ace, choice is given to consider 1 point or 11 points as per the player's wish. The player who gets the value of cards to 21 wins the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If Ace and a face card is given to a player and the dealer has cards whose sum is 21, the Ace and face card wins as it is special case called \"Blackjack\". "
